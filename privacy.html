            <h3>Acceptance of Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>Welcome to SoftwareWorks (“SoftwareWorks,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) and our Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is important and affects your legal rights, so please read carefully.</p>
            <p>By accessing or using www.softwareworks.com (“Website”) and/or various related websites and services (collectively, the “Site”), you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and all of the terms incorporated herein by reference. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information SoftwareWorks collects through the Site and how we collect, use, maintain, protect, and share that information.</p>
            <p>Our processing of personal data, such as your name, address, email address, or telephone number, shall be undertaken consistent with the requirements of applicable privacy laws and this Privacy Policy. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to provide to users and potential users of our Website information about the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use, and process and to advise data subjects of their rights. Whether we serve as the data controller or processor, we have implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the protection of personal data processed through the Site. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so please understand that absolute protection is not assured.</p>
            <p>By using the Site, you accept and expressly agree to our practices surrounding the collection, use, maintenance, protection, and sharing of information provided by you in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, you cannot, and we do not authorize you to, access, browse, or use the Site.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of the Site after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.</p>
            <p>Our Website and other products and services may include platforms, websites, applications, and other products and services provided by third parties, and these other third parties may have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to read such third-party privacy policies before providing information on or through them.</p>

            <h3>Children Under the Age of 13</h3>
            <p>The Site is not intended for use by children and children under the age of 13 are prohibited from using the Site. SoftwareWorks does not knowingly collect any information from children, nor is the Site directed to children. If you are under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself to us.</p>
            <p>By accessing, using, and/or submitting information to or through the Site, you represent that you are not younger than age 13. If we learn that we have received any information directly from a child under age 13 without his/her parent’s written consent, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or his/her parent or legal guardian) to inform the child that he/she cannot use the Site, and we will subsequently delete that information. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at privacy@softwareworks.com.</p>

            <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>Some portions of the Site require us to learn more about you so that we can best meet your needs.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal Information We Collect Directly From You</strong></p>
            <p>We receive personal information directly from you when you voluntarily provide us with such personal information, including, without limitation, the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>personal data (such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, and any other identifier by which you may be contacted online or offline);</li>
                <li>other identifying information that you voluntarily choose to provide to us, including without limitation unique identifiers and personal information in messages that you send to us.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may also collect additional information, which may be personal information, as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent. You may still access and use some portions of the Site if you choose not to provide us with any personal information, but features of the Site that require your personal information will not be accessible to you.</p>
            <p><strong>Information Automatically Collected from Your Site Use</strong></p>
            <p>In order to access and use certain areas or features of the Site, you consent to our collection and use of certain information about your use of the Site through the use of tracking technologies or by other passive means. Your consent to our access and use of this “passively collected” information includes, but is not limited to, the domain name of the website that allowed you to navigate to the Site, search engines used, the internet protocol (IP) address used, the length of time spent on the Site, the pages you looked at on the Site, other webpages you visited before and after visiting the Site, the type of internet browser you have, the frequency of your visits to the Site, and other relevant statistics, including the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Traffic Data:</strong> We also may automatically collect certain data when you use the Site, such as: (1) IP address; (2) domain server; (3) type of device(s) used to access the Site; (4) web browser(s) used to access the Site; (5) referring webpage or other source through which you accessed the Site; (6) geolocation information; and (7) other statistics and information associated with the interaction between your browser or device and the Site (collectively, “Traffic Data”). Depending on applicable law, some Traffic Data may be personal information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We collect this information: (1) Directly from you when you provide it to us; (2) Automatically as you navigate through the Site; and (3) From third parties, for example, our business partners and service providers.</p>

            <h3>How We Collect Information</h3>
            <p>We collect information (including personal information and Traffic Data) when you use and interact with the Site, and in some cases from third party sources. Such means of collection include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you use the Site’s interactive tools and services;</li>
                <li>When you voluntarily provide information in free-form text boxes through the Site or through responses to contact forms, surveys, questionnaires, and the like;</li>
                <li>If you use a location-enabled browser, we may receive information about your location and mobile device, as applicable;</li>
                <li>Through cookies, web beacons, analytics services, and other tracking technology (collectively, “Tracking Tools”), as described below;</li>
                <li>When you use the “Contact Us” function on the Site, send us an email, or otherwise contact us.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tracking Tools, Behavioral Advertising, and Opt-Out Options</h3>
            <p><strong>Tracking Tools.</strong> We may use tools outlined below in order to provide our Site to, advertise to, and to better understand users.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> “Cookies” are small computer files transferred to your computing device that contain information such as user ID, user preferences, lists of pages visited, and activities conducted while using the Site. We use cookies to improve or tailor the Site, measure performance, customize user experiences with the Site, and for analytics and fraud prevention. For more information on cookies, including how to control your cookie settings and preferences, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</li>
                <li>Some cookies are placed by a third party on your device and provide information to us and third parties about your browsing habits (such as your visits to our Site, the pages you have visited, and the links and advertisements you have clicked). These cookies can be used to determine whether certain third party services are being used, to identify your interests, and to serve advertisements relevant to you. We do not control third party cookies.</li>
                <li><strong>Flash Cookies:</strong> Certain features of our Site may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and on our Site. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies.</li>
                <li><strong>Web Beacons:</strong> “Web Beacons” (a.k.a. clear GIFs or pixel tags) are tiny graphic image files embedded in a web page or email that may be used to collect information about the use of our Site and the emails, special promotions, or newsletters that we send. The information collected by Web Beacons allows us to analyze how many people are using the Site, using selected publishers’ websites, or opening emails, and for what purpose.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Web Service Analytics:</strong> We may use third-party analytics services in connection with the Site, including, for example, to register mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity, and text typed into the Site. We use the information collected from these services to help make the Site easier to use and as otherwise set forth in Section 5 (How We Use Your Information). These analytics services generally do not collect personal information unless you voluntarily provide it and generally do not track your browsing habits across web services that do not use their services.</p>
            <p><strong>Mobile Device Identifiers:</strong> As with other Tracking Tools, mobile device identifiers help SoftwareWorks learn more about our users’ demographics and internet behaviors in order to personalize and improve the Site. Mobile device identifiers are data stored on mobile devices that may track mobile device and data and activities occurring on and through it, as well as the applications installed on it. Mobile device identifiers enable collection of personal information (such as media access control, address, and location) and Traffic Data.</p>
            <p><strong>Behavioral Advertising:</strong> We may use a type of advertising commonly known as interest-based or online behavioral advertising. This means that some of our partners use Tracking Tools, such as cookies, pixel tags, and web beacons, to collect information about a user’s online activities to display SoftwareWorks ads to the user based on the user’s interests (“Behavioral Advertising”). Such partners may include third-party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks or platforms, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, and other third-party service providers (collectively, “Advertising Service Providers”). Other Tracking Tools used by our partners may collect information when you use the Site, such as IP address, mobile device ID, operating system, browser, web page interactions, geographic location, and demographic information, such as gender and age range. These Tracking Tools help SoftwareWorks learn more about our users’ demographics and internet behaviors.</p>
            <p><strong>Options for Opting out of Cookies and Mobile Device Identifiers:</strong> Some web browsers allow you to reject cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed on your computer, tablet, or mobile device. You may be able to reject mobile device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device. Although you are not required to accept SoftwareWorks’ cookies or mobile device identifiers, if you block or reject them, you may not have access to all features available through the Site.</p>
            <p>You may opt out of receiving certain cookies and certain trackers by visiting the <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org">Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt out page</a> or the <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info">Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) opt out page</a>, or by installing the DAA’s AppChoice app (for iOS; for Android) on your mobile computing device. When you use these opt-out features, an “opt-out” Cookie will be placed on your computer, tablet, or mobile computing device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertising from NAI or DAA member companies. If you delete cookies on your computer, tablet, or mobile computing device, you may need to opt out again. For information about how to opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile devices, please visit <a href="http://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertising-choices-on-a-mobile-device">http://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertising-choices-on-a-mobile-device</a>. You will need to opt out of each browser and device for which you desire to apply these opt-out features.</p>
            <p>Even after opting out of Behavioral Advertising, you may still see SoftwareWorks advertisements that are not interest-based (i.e., not targeted toward you). Also, opting out does not mean that SoftwareWorks is no longer using Tracking Tools — SoftwareWorks still may collect information about your use of the Site even after you have opted out of Behavioral Advertising and may still serve advertisements to you via the Site based on information it collects via the Site.</p>
            <p>Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Site are served by third-parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers, and application providers. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use our Site. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across the Site, different applications and sites, and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content. We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies and other Tracking Tools by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that some cookies placed by third parties can continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Site.</p>
            <p><strong>How SoftwareWorks Responds to Browser “Do Not Track” (DNT) Signals:</strong> Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) or similar feature that signals to web services that a visitor does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked. If a web service operator elects to respond to a particular DNT signal, the web service operator may refrain from collecting certain personal information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many web service operators, including SoftwareWorks, do not proactively respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, visit <a href="http://allaboutdnt.com">http://allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>

            </ul>

            <h3>How We Share Your Information</h3>
            <p>In certain circumstances, and in order to perform the Site and our provided services to you, we may share certain information that we collect from you, as described in this section:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not sell email addresses or any other personal information to third parties. We may share your personal information with our partners to customize or display our advertising.</li>
                <li>We may share your personal information and/or Traffic Data with our partners who perform operational services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, data storage, security, insurance verification, web service analytics, or ad serving) and/or who make certain services, features, or functionality available to our users.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross Device Matching:</strong> To determine if users have interacted with content across multiple devices and to match such devices, we work with partners who analyze device activity data and/or rely on your information (including demographic, geographic, and interest-based data). To supplement this analysis, we also provide de-identified data to these partners. Based on this data, we may then display targeted advertisements across devices that we believe are associated or use this data to further analyze usage of the Site across devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may transfer your personal information to another company in connection with a proposed merger, sale, acquisition, or other change of ownership or control by or of SoftwareWorks (whether in whole or in part).

            <h3>Your Rights and Choices</h3>
            <p>The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
            <p><strong>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</strong></p>
            <p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
                <li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
                <li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>
                <li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
                <li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</li>
                <li>If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>sales, to the extent the common flow of information in the digital analytics and advertising ecosystem are considered as such, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and</li>
                    <li>disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Do Not Sell My Information</strong></p>
            <p>To the extent that sharing personal information with third-parties in the digital analytics and advertising ecosystem is considered a “sale,” under the CCPA, you have the right to opt out of a sale of your personal information to a third-party. Please note that this does not stop us from distributing this information within our organization across business units. Additionally, your right to opt out does not stop all transfers to third parties as we can continue to provide your personal information to our service providers pursuant to a written contract that meets requirements within the CCPA. Furthermore, we can continue to provide data that does not meet the definition of personal information.</p>
            <p>This right to opt out applies to all California consumers ages 16 or older and may be exercised at any time. We will honor all such requests unless you subsequently decide to opt in to the sale of your personal information.</p>
            <p>The sale of personal information does not include if you direct us to interact with a third-party, any third-party alerts that you have opted out of, the sharing of information is necessary to perform a business purpose and meets the other conditions specified, or the information is transferred as part of an asset in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other change of control of SoftwareWorks.</p>
            <p>If you wish to exercise your right to opt out, please submit a request via privacy@softwareworks.com or at 1-800-555-1234. We will honor your request for twelve (12) months before we ask you to opt in to the sale of your personal information.</p>
            <p><strong>Deletion Request Rights</strong></p>
            <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
            <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you;</li>
                <li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;</li>
                <li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;</li>
                <li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law;</li>
                <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.);</li>
                <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent;</li>
                <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us;</li>
                <li>Comply with a legal obligation;</li>
                <li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</strong></p>
            <p>To exercise the access, data portability, opt out, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us in one of the ways listed below in the Contact Information section.</p>
            <p>Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
            <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;</li>
                <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
            <p><strong>Response Timing and Format</strong></p>
            <p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
            <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
            <p><strong>Non-Discrimination</strong></p>
            <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
                <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
                <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
                <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
            </ul>
