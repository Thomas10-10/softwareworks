            <p>This User agreement is by and between SoftwareWorks, an Arizona corporation, and You, Your assigns, agents, and contractors (“You”) and is made effective as of the date of electronic execution. You also agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement for transactions entered into on Your behalf by anyone acting as Your agent, and transactions entered into by anyone who uses Your account. This agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of Your use of SoftwareWorks website and software.</p>

            <h3>The Software</h3>
            <p>SoftwareWorks (SW) software provides the user the ability to monitor the Windows 10 or 11 computer speed, stability, and security and provides the user recommendations on how to repair their computer. The software is intended to provide the user “self” implemented computer help. Additionally, if required, the licensed user may interact via chat available in the software with a technician that may provide the user self-help recommendations.</p>
            <p>The customer must comply with all laws. If SoftwareWorks believes that a crime has, may have, or will be committed in the future, SoftwareWorks may in its sole discretion report the information forming that belief to authorities and fully cooperate with authorities and deinstall the licensed software.</p>

            <h3>Availability of Service</h3>
            <p>The chat feature to provide self-help advice is available seven days a week from 8:00am to 8:00pm local time.</p>

            <h3>Fees</h3>
            <p>In consideration for SoftwareWorks licensed software, SoftwareWorks will charge $9.95 at installation and $9.95 per month for the monitoring software providing its services or granting a license to certain SoftwareWorks software for the term of this Agreement. You agree to pay SoftwareWorks service fee upon SoftwareWorks granting a license. SoftwareWorks reserves the right to increase the fees at any time, and the increased fees shall only be posted on the SoftwareWorks website, which You should review from time to time.</p>

            <h3>Payment Method</h3>
            <p>You agree to provide and maintain a valid credit card or debit card on file with SoftwareWorks to purchase service. If You select to pay monthly, You will be billed in advance each month on the date You purchased service for the next month’s service, excluding the 29th, 30th, and 31st; services purchased on those dates will be billed on the 28th. You agree to keep a valid credit or debit card on file with SoftwareWorks billing throughout the term of this Agreement.</p>

            <h3>Monthly Plans</h3>
            <p>Monthly plans are billed month to month. You may cancel the software license at any time. Automatic billing will occur until You cancel Your license in writing.</p>

            <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
            <p>Our monthly license fee is month to month. You can cancel at any time without penalty. If for any reason SoftwareWorks is unable to charge Your credit card or debit card with the full amount of the service provided, SoftwareWorks may pursue all available remedies in order to obtain payment, including turning Your account over to a collection agency. In addition, SoftwareWorks is entitled to recover any sums expended in connection with the collection of fees, including reasonable collection agency fees and attorney’s fees.</p>

            <h3>Account Reinstatement</h3>
            <p>If a membership is canceled or terminated by You, the membership may be reinstated without an additional Activation Fee up to 90 days following the date of cancellation. After this period, a fee may be charged for reinstatement at the discretion of SoftwareWorks.</p>

            <h3>Your Cooperation</h3>
            <p>You agree that Your computer has a high-speed or broadband connection to the Internet (specifically a quality, stable broadband connection with a minimum continuous connection speed of 256Kb/s upload and download).
